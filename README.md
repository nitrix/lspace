# Lonesome Space

Lonesome Space - Real-time 2D strategy/sandbox game.

**Playing**

Download the latest release from the releases tab on GitHub for your operating system.

Unzip the archive somewhere, then locate and launch the `lspace` executable from within.

Enjoy!

**Documentation**

Coming soon.

**Distribution**

To build the releases for Windows, Linux and Mac, we use a cross-compilation docker image.

Therefore, make sure you arm yourself with the latest docker and proceed with the commands below:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:nitrix/lspace.git
$ cd lspace
$ ./scripts/dist.sh
```

Once that's done, you should see the zips appear in the `dist` directory.

They contain the entire game; executable and assets included.

**Licensing**

We use the [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/) license which you can read in detail [here](UNLICENSE).

This gives you legal freedom to do absolutely anything you want with this game.

**Community**

We will eventually have a website at https://lonesomespace.com; please be patient.

Questions, feedback and contributions are all welcome.
